      <description>In the last post, we have seen a method for producing a series of samples of connected simple graphs where each sample exclusively depends on the previous sample. In this post, we will provide some statements of theorems and definitions which were a bit implicit in the previous post.
The Metropolis-Hastings method that we chose in the last post guarantees that our series of samples will at some point &amp;rsquo;look&amp;rsquo; like it has been drawn independently from our target distribution.</description>
