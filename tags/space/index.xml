      <description>Motivation We&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a previous post, that it would be desirable to have isometries between a given graph to some \( N \) dimensional euclidean space. We also saw that this is in general impossible - even for very simple graphs.
In this post, we are going to explore a simple fix for that, which consists in transforming the metric of the graph in an invertible way before looking for an isometry.</description>

      <description>Motivation Last year, I became interested in (approximate) isometric embeddings of graphs with the path distance metric into metric spaces whose elements can be represented by coordinates - like \(N \)-dimensional euclidean space , \( \mathbb{E}^N \).
Let&amp;rsquo;s consider an isometric mapping from a graph with a path distance metric to \(N\)-dimensional euclidean space for instance: \( f: G \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^N \). Isometric means that the distances between each two vertices \(v, w \in G\) is preserved by \(f\), i.</description>
